Feedback
===

So, during this year's (2012) Presidental debates, CNN had this live audience feedback graph running throughout the debate. I thought, cool they must be gathering that using some sort of web technology. I was wrong, they had a small group of viewers in a single room with controllers in their hands.

I thought, I can do better.

Thus, after a few frantic hours hacking, I give you Feedback. A realtime graph averaging feedback across all the logged in users.

This app consists of a single page with a graph and a slider. The graph shows the average sentiment (positive or negative) for everyone connected to the current channel. You can adjust your sentimenet by moving the slider right, for positive, and left, for negative.

You can view a demo of it here: <a href="http://feedback-225.herokuapp.com/">http://feedback-225.herokuapp.com/</a>

It works great on the iPad (and probably other tablets as well).
